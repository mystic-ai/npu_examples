### Model Description

The T5 model was presented in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pretraining objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new “Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus”, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.

### How to use it

To use this model as an API you will need your API Token. You can find it in the homepage of Neuro's Dashboard. If you don't have a Neuro account, you can register in the [Neuro Dashboard](https://dashboard.getneuro.ai/) and upgrade your account to either Developer or Premium to be able to use this model inmediately.

You will need the `npu` library which you can install with `pip install --upgrade npu`

Using your API Token, this is all the code you need to run the model.

```python
import os
import npu

npu.api(os.environ["API_TOKEN"], deployed=True)

input_article = '''...''' # Put your text/article to summarize in here

print(npu.predict("60a50d0fbcfe327d47f4127a", [[input_article]]))

```
